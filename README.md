# FACS_recognition
This repository applies a neural network to frontal face image sequences to find facial Action Units (AUs). AUs, part of the Facial Action Coding System ([FACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System)), are a compelling way to analyze facial expressions, as the basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and contempt) have AUs in common. Paul Ekman, who established FACS, ran studies showing that people in isolated, rural communities recognize facial expressions just as people in cities recognize facial expressions. The [research](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-07999-001) suggests some facial expressions are universal.
